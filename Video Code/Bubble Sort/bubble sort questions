**# Practical Question:**
**Problem Statement:**

*You are given an unsorted list of integers unsorted_list. Write a Python program to implement Bubble Sort to sort the list in ascending order.*

**Instructions:**

Use the provided function bubble_sort to implement the solution.
Ensure that your program sorts the list in ascending order.
Print the sorted list after applying Bubble Sort. *italicised text*

```
# Given unsorted list of integers
unsorted_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

# Output: "Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]"
```
